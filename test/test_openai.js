[00:00] John Smith: Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's sprint planning meeting.

[00:15] Sarah Johnson: Hi John, glad to be here. I've prepared the user stories we discussed last week.

[00:30] Mike Chen: Morning all. Just to clarify, are we still targeting the same deadline we discussed before?

[00:45] John Smith: Yes, the deadline hasn't changed. Sarah, can you walk us through the stories?

[01:00] Sarah Johnson: Sure. So we have three main features to implement. The first one is the user authentication system...

[01:30] Mike Chen: Sorry to interrupt, but I'm concerned about the timeline. Last sprint we struggled with similar complexity.

[01:45] John Smith: That's a fair point Mike. What do you think would be more realistic?

[02:00] Sarah Johnson: Well, maybe we should prioritize the most critical features first?

[02:15] Mike Chen: Exactly. I think we're being overly optimistic again.

[02:30] John Smith: Alright, let's break this down feature by feature and estimate more carefully.

[02:45] Sarah Johnson: Sounds good. For the authentication system, I estimate about 5 days.

[03:00] Mike Chen: Hmm, that seems tight given the security requirements we need to implement.

[03:15] John Smith: Mike, what would your estimate be?

[03:30] Mike Chen: I'd say 7-8 days to be safe, including proper testing.

[03:45] Sarah Johnson: Okay, I can see that. Better to be conservative.

[04:00] John Smith: Great, let's document that and move to the next feature.
