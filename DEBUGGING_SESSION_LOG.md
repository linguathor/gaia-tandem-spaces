   # Zoom Webhook Authentication Debugging Session Log

## Current Status (October 26, 2025)

**🎯 SOLUTION FOUND!**

The root cause has been identified: **webhook download URLs require different authentication** than standard Zoom API endpoints.

**THE FIX**: Instead of using `webhook_download` URLs from webhook payloads, use the **Zoom Cloud Recording API** (`GET /v2/meetings/{meetingId}/recordings`) to get proper download URLs that work with OAuth Bearer tokens.

## Problem Summary

### What Was Broken ❌
- **Webhook Download URLs**: The `/rec/webhook_download/...` URLs in webhook payloads don't accept OAuth Bearer tokens
- **Multiple auth attempts failed**: Tried access_token parameter, Bearer header with passcode, Bearer header alone - all returned 401 Forbidden (errorCode 300)
- **Root cause**: Webhook URLs have special authentication requirements not compatible with Server-to-Server OAuth

### The Solution ✅
- **Use Zoom API instead**: Call `GET https://api.zoom.us/v2/meetings/{meetingUuid}/recordings`
- **API returns proper URLs**: These download URLs work with standard OAuth Bearer tokens
- **Simple authentication**: Just `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header

## Latest Fix (October 26, 2025)

Modified `handleTranscriptCompleted()` to:
1. Call `getZoomRecordings(meetingUuid)` to fetch recording details from API
2. Extract transcript file from API response
3. Download using API URL with Bearer token authentication
4. No need for passcodes or URL parameters

**Code changes**: Simplified download logic from 150+ lines of fallback attempts to ~30 lines using proper API endpoint.

## Problem Summary

### What Works ✅
- **OAuth Token Generation**: Successfully obtaining tokens with `account_credentials` grant type
- **Correct Scopes**: Token now contains required cloud recording scopes:
  - `cloud_recording:read:recording:admin`
  - `cloud_recording:read:meeting_transcript:admin`
  - No more marketplace scopes
- **Webhook Verification**: All webhook signatures verify correctly
- **Environment Setup**: All credentials properly configured with rotated secrets

### What's Still Broken ❌
- **Transcript Download**: Returns 401 Forbidden (errorCode 300) despite valid OAuth token
- **File Access**: Cannot download VTT transcript files from webhook URLs

## Technical Details

### Authentication Evolution
1. **Started with**: `client_credentials` grant → marketplace scopes → 401 errors
2. **Fixed to**: `account_credentials` grant → cloud recording scopes → still 401 on download
3. **Current approach**: Multi-method authentication fallback system

### Key Environment Variables
```
ZOOM_CLIENT_ID=p4iq9WLpSqmLZBfPwTyKlg
ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET=lRRxtaqkFXCFMxpyV2cRTXmnlVG93eBI (rotated for security)
ZOOM_ACCOUNT_ID=7h15gDu3QK6p1BLGeqtknA
ZOOM_WEBHOOK_SECRET_TOKEN=[configured]
OPENAI_API_KEY=[configured]
```

### Latest Code Changes (Commit: 9be0747)
Implemented multi-method authentication fallback in `handleTranscriptCompleted()`:

1. **Method 1**: URL with both passcode and access_token as query parameters
   ```
   download_url?pwd=passcode&access_token=token
   ```

2. **Method 2**: URL with passcode + Bearer header
   ```
   download_url?pwd=passcode
   Headers: Authorization: Bearer token
   ```

3. **Method 3**: Clean URL + Bearer header only
   ```
   download_url
   Headers: Authorization: Bearer token
   ```

## How to Continue Testing

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Start a Zoom meeting** with recording and transcript enabled
2. **Talk for a few seconds** to generate transcript content
3. **End the meeting** to trigger webhook events
4. **Check logs** for authentication method results:
   - Look for "SUCCESS: [method] worked!" messages
   - Identify which authentication approach succeeds

### Expected Log Messages
- `SUCCESS: URL with access_token parameter worked!` (Method 1)
- `SUCCESS: Bearer header with passcode worked!` (Method 2) 
- `SUCCESS: Bearer header only worked!` (Method 3)

### If Still Failing
Consider these potential issues:
- Webhook download URLs may require different endpoint authentication
- Passcode format or encoding issues
- Zoom's webhook download system may have specific requirements not documented

## Recent Debugging History

### Session 1: Initial 401 Errors
- Discovered OAuth tokens had marketplace scopes instead of cloud recording scopes
- Root cause: Using `client_credentials` instead of `account_credentials`

### Session 2: Authentication Fix
- Implemented `account_credentials` OAuth flow
- Added `ZOOM_ACCOUNT_ID` environment variable
- Rotated credentials for security
- Confirmed correct scopes in token response

### Session 3: Download URL Investigation
- Analyzed webhook download URL construction
- Implemented comprehensive logging for all authentication attempts
- Created multi-method fallback system

## Code Architecture

### Main Components
- **`index.js`**: Express server with webhook handling
- **`getZoomAccessToken()`**: OAuth implementation using account_credentials
- **`handleTranscriptCompleted()`**: Multi-method download authentication
- **Comprehensive logging**: Debug output for all authentication steps

### Key Functions
- `getZoomAccessToken(forceRefresh)`: Gets OAuth token with cloud recording scopes
- `handleTranscriptCompleted(payload)`: Processes transcript webhooks with fallback auth
- Webhook signature verification for security

## Zoom App Configuration
✅ **Scopes Enabled**: All required cloud recording scopes are properly configured
- `cloud_recording:read:list_account_recordings`
- `cloud_recording:read:list_user_recordings` 
- `cloud_recording:read:list_recording_files`
- `cloud_recording:read:recording`
- `cloud_recording:read:meeting_transcript`

## Contact Context
This system is designed to:
1. Receive Zoom webhook notifications when transcripts are ready
2. Download VTT transcript files using OAuth authentication
3. Process transcripts with OpenAI for meeting feedback
4. Send feedback to meeting participants

## Files to Check When Resuming
- `index.js` - Main application logic
- `.env` - Environment variables (credentials)
- `TROUBLESHOOTING_REPORT.md` - Detailed technical analysis
- Vercel deployment logs - Runtime authentication attempts

## Quick Resume Commands
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\User\OneDrive\__2025\Programming\gaia-tandem-spaces\zoom-feedback-backend"
git log --oneline -5  # Check recent commits
git status            # Check working directory
npm start            # Test locally (if needed)
```
